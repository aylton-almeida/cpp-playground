# C++ Playground

A playground to test out C++ features and libraries.

## Running

To run any of the programs you can use the `make dev` command passing the `file` parameter. This will build the program and run it.

```bash
make dev file=binary_search
```

## Programs

1. [Arrays](./src/arrays.cpp): A program to test out arrays, for loops and pointers in C++.
2. [Binary Search](./src/binary_search.cpp): A recursive binary search implementation.
3. [Counting Sort](./src/counting_sort.cpp): A counting sort implementation.
4. [GCD](./src/gcd.cpp): A program to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
5. [Graphs](./src/graphs.cpp): A program that, given a graph, checks if it is connected (Using DFS) and the distance between two vertexes (Using BFS).
6. [Guess The Number](./src/guess_the_number.cpp): A simple game to guess a number.
7. [Insertion Sort](./src/insertion_sort.cpp): An insertion sort implementation.
8. [Max](./src/max.cpp): A program that finds the maximum number in an array, both recursive and iterative.
9. [Merge Sort](./src/merge_sort.cpp): A merge sort implementation.
10. [Selection Sort](./src/selection_sort.cpp): A selection sort implementation.
11. [Strings](./src/strings.cpp): A program to test out strings in C++.

## Utils

The [Utils](./src/utils.cpp) file contains some helper functions to make the programs more readable.
